			<div class="text"> And let's be honest, where is that truer than coding? I started with basic
				HTML and CSS before switching to Bootstrap, Flexboxes, and animations. I began in vanilla JavaScript, then
				leveraged JQuery libraries before reverting back React. Then of course there were Express servers, the Node
				platform, SQL with ORM, Mongo with ODM, Ajax calls, Axios calls, and and so much more. Every day I code, I master
				something new, and that's not even including the soft skills that come with RESTFUL, Agile, and SCRUM.
			</div>
			<div class="text"> Every day in brings change, and the ability to adapt is paramount. Fortunately, change is what I
				do. Always looking for a place to bring my analytical and logical acumen to bear, I explored different fields to
				find the perfect fit.
				Starting at the Cornell School of Hotel Administration, I graduated and headed to the University of Pennsylvania
				for law school.
				Two years as a civil litigator then saw a transition into education before, finally, I discovered the wonderful
				world of coding.
			</div>
			<div class="text"> I've changed a lot through the years. That's good. By constantly changing, I got unique and
				varied opportunities
				to polish my skills, skills that I can now bring fully to bear as a full-stack web developer. And of course, since
				I'm so familiar with change,
				I can adapt and evolve alongside every innovation the field has to offer. Like me, code is constantly changing to
				reach newer and
				better heights.
			</div>
			<div class="text">And that's a very good thing indeed.</div>

						<div class="text">Don't overreact, but we're now in React. After a lot of time in JQuery, we made yet another
							shift to learn React. Using this far more efficient system with it's virtual DOM, we recreated various
							functionalities from previous projects (custom ajax calls now made through Axios, dynamic generation, Bootstrap,
							and more) in a new setup for quicker renders. And just because I can, I also created an admin function to change
							the UI according to the login state that grants additional functionality to registered users.

							flexible MongoDB. Interfacted with Mongoose to add some clear and controlling constraints, this app's basic
							functionality is to pull information from the database and render it to the page. I additionally added
							dynamically generated notifactions and interfaces so that the user could have a shopping experience similar to
							the real thing, all organized into a UI based on the Marvel comic theme. After all, when you get the word

							finest of JQuery, of course) and render the perfect office mate for the user. Give it a shot. It's good fun.</div>

							picture with a built-in photo app made with HTML canvas, (3.) analyze the emotions of that picture, and (3.)
							recommend recipes based on those emotions. Multi-facted and beyond the scope of any individual, my focus was
							on the JavaScript, calling in the emotion information, building custom algorithms based on psychological and
							physiological research, then converting them into culinary terms usable by the next API. Give it a whirl for
